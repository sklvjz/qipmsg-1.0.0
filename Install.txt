This document explains how to compile and install qipmsg.

Compiling qipmsg should be easy. It only depends on Qt. To compile qipmsg,
you need qt version 4.3 or greater.


1) How to make a rpm package for Fedora
2) How to make a deb package for Ubuntu
3) Generic compilation
4) Changing installation path


1) How to make a rpm package for Fedora
---------------------------------------
Run command:

	# rpmbuid -tb qipmsg-0.9.x.tar.bz2

You'll find the rpm package under /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/

2) How to make a deb package for Ubuntu
---------------------------------------

	$ mkdir qipmsg/
	$ cp qipmsg-0.9.x.tar.gz qipmsg/
	$ cd qipmsg
	$ cp qipmsg-0.9.x.tar.gz qipmsg_0.9.x.orig.tar.gz
	$ tar zxvf qipmsg_0.9.x.tar.gz; cd qipmsg-0.9.x
	$ debuild

You'll found the deb package in the directory above the current directory.

3) Compile qipmsg on opensuse
-----------------------------
You need first install libqt4-devel, libqt4 package. After this, Just run:

	$ make QMAKE=qmake LRELEASE=lrelease
	$ make install


4) Generic compilation
----------------------
You need at least Qt 4.3 to compile qipmsg. Older version not tested.

Be sure you have installed the Qt 4 development package. Its name maybe
qt-devel, libqt4-dev or similar. You also need to install alsa development
package, Its name maybe alsa-devel, libasound2-dev or similar.

Uncompress the source code, open a console and enter in the qipmsg-0.9.x
directory. Run:

	$ make

If everything is ok now you can install it with command:

	$ make install

That will install qipmsg in /usr.

If "make" fails, it's probably because the Qt 3 qmake has been used instead of
the Qt 4 one. It seems that some distros have renamed that tool to qmake-qt4.
Others may have installed in another directory.
Look at the contents of the qt4-devel package (or whatever its name is) and
find out where it is.

Now type something like this (just examples):
make QMAKE=qmake-qt4
or
make QMAKE=/usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake


5) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default qipmsg will be installed in /usr. You can change it by
using PREFIX and DESTDIR.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr/local
make PREFIX=/usr/local install

That would install qipmsg under /usr/local.

DESTDIR will be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

That would compile qipmsg for /usr but in fact it will be installed in
/tmp/usr/.
